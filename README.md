# ChanGeom

This project is a continuation of work done by G. Burch Fisher, Bodo Bookhagen, and Colin B. Amos[1]. The purpose of the project is to translate from MATLAB to Python a set of scripts that perform several image processing functions on rasterized traces of river channels, therefore making the ChanGeom algorithm developed by G. Burch Fisher et al. completely free to use.

The chanops.py script is the Python implementation of the algorithms in the "Matlab" folder and is new work, all other scripts were written by G. B. Fisher et al. 

The chanops.py script should work right out of the box as long as you have Python 2.7 installed. If you are not on a Unix based system you may have to change the format of the path to the source raster though (on line 16).
